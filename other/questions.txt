1. How many hours?
    About 6 hours, though the vast majority of this 
    was getting the styling right and writing the content. 
    I took my time doing this and I feel as though 
    I could have completed it quicker.
    The semantic HTML itself (without the styling elements like div containers)
    only took about 30 minutes.

2. Online resources?
    Mainly your classes and previous experience. 
    Some limited use of MDN and W3 schools.

3. Help from friends?
    None

4. Help from instructors?
    None

5. Rate difficulty?
    Easy for the semantic HTML.
    The CSS was not difficult, just took a bit of time/tinkering.
    Would be confident with higher difficulty.

    The hardest part by far was having to stay within
    the confines of what we've learned in class
    so far. Having previous experience, it was
    tough to separate what I know versus what
    we've done.

    I know this is a problem specific to me, and
    I understand that others don't have the
    experience I have!
