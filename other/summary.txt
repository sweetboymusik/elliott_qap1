All About Stoats

Brief
Stoats (mustela erminea), also commonly known as the Ermine, is a small mammal in the family mustelidae (the same family as weasels, otters, and badgers), making them carnivorous animals. Their current conservation status is LC (Least Concern).

Appearance
Stoats have small, elongated bodies that measure anywhere between 170mm to 330mm in length and can weight anywhere between 25g to 116g. Their tails are roughly a little more than a third of their total body length, and have an elongated neck and  small triangular head. The color of their fur changes from brown in the summer months to white during the winter months.

In an example of sexual dimorphism, males tend to be twice as large as females, which is considered a disadvantage in hunting and chasing smaller prey into their burrows. 

They are often confused with the weasel. The main difference between the two is their size (the weasel is smaller than the stoat), but other differences include fur colors and tail length.

Location/Habitat:
Stoats can be found throughout the northern regions of Eurasia and North America, though they were introduced to New Zealand in the 19th century to control rabbit population. Unfortunately, this introduction has created a significant threat to New Zealand’s bird population. 

They love to reside in wooded areas, marshes, and meadows. They make their dens out of various materials in their surroundings including stone, logs, and even the burrows of other animals., and line them with vegetation, fur and feathers.

Breeding/Offspring
Stoats mate in the summer, but females do not give birth until spring of the following year. Implantation is delayed by around 10 months, making the gestation period upwards of 300 days. Because of this, females give birth to only one litter per year. 

Litters usually consist of 4-9 offspring, called kits. Stoats are an altricial species (like humans), meaning that their young are born helpless. In fact, they are born deaf, blind, and almost hairless! By 12 weeks, the kits are weaned and can hunt on their own.

Diet
Stoats feed mainly on smaller rodents, but also consume other animals, birds, and their eggs. They hunt primarily at night. While hunting, they tend to move around in zig-zag patterns, checking every nook and cranny for food, hunting down smaller prey into their burrows and overpowering them (and sometimes claiming the burrow as their own den). They can also climb and swim!

They also hunt rabbits and hares, which are 5 times its own size! The stoat manages this feat by biting the rabbits at the base of their skull. This technique doesn’t actually kill the rabbit directly, but rather causes the prey to die of shock.

Lifespan/Predators
A stoat has a relatively short lifespan. They can live up to 7 years, even more in captivity, but in the wild usually only survive between 1-2 years.

Due to their size, stoats are preyed upon by many larger carnivores.

List of predators:
    - badgers
    - birds of prey
    - domestic cats
    - foxes
    - sables
